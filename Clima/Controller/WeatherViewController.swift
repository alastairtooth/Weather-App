Need to addthe UITextFieldDelegate bit at the top too.  The weatherManager.delegate is tells WeatherManager Struct in WeatherManager.Swift that the WeatherViewController is an acceptable delegate, as per the created protocols.

//The below 'Mark' line makes a comment interact with the page of code, and creates as section-break in the .swift file that is viewable in the documents, and in the dropdown above  The mark comment was created as a Snippet by highlighting the '//MORK: - ' (change the O to an A) text, right clicking and pressing 'Create code snippet'.  To make the field where the text needed to be added you write <#whatevertextyouwant# > - the second space was so it wouldn't turn into one.
